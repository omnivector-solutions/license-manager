Welcome to the License Manager documentation!
=============================================

The License Manager is a license scheduling middleware that operates as an interface between
an HPC cluster and one or more 3rd party license servers. The License Manager
introduces the concept of "license bookings" which are used to provide an alternate
source of truth for what licenses are actually available.
