The `License Manager` can be provisioned using two approaches:

* Use `Docker Compose` to run the services
* Create a `Slurm` cluster and `License Manager` components using `Juju`.  

You can also provision the components manually, but this guide will focus on the two approaches mentioned above.

## Instructions
