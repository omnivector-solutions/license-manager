"""
The SlurmctldProlog executable.

This prolog is responsible for checking if feature tokens are available
and making booking requests by communicating with the license-manager agent
(which should be running on the slurmctld host).

Executing this script will result in either an exit(0) or exit(1). Slurm will
proceed with scheduling the job if the exit status is 0, and will not proceed
if the exit status is anything other then 0, e.g. 1.
